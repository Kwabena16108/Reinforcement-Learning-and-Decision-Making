    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an $N$-sided die, along with a corresponding Boolean mask\n",
    "vector, `is_bad_side` (i.e., a vector of ones and zeros). You can assume\n",
    "that $1<N\\leq30$, and the vector `is_bad_side` is also of size $N$ and\n",
    "$1$ indexed (since there is no $0$ side on the die). The game of DieN is\n",
    "played as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You start with $0$ dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  At any time you have the option to roll the die or to quit the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  **ROLL**:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.  If you roll a number not in `is_bad_side`, you receive that\n",
    "            many dollars (e.g., if you roll the number $2$ and $2$ is\n",
    "            not a bad side -- meaning the second element of the vector\n",
    "            `is_bad_side` is $0$, then you receive $2$ dollars). Repeat\n",
    "            step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2.  If you roll a number in `is_bad_side`, then you lose all the\n",
    "            money obtained in previous rolls and the game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.  **QUIT**:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1.  You keep all the money gained from previous rolls and the\n",
    "            game ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You will implement your solution using the `solve()` method\n",
    "    in the code below.\n",
    "    \n",
    "-   Your return value should be the number of dollars you expect to\n",
    "    win for a specific value of `is_bad_side`, if you follow an\n",
    "    optimal policy. That is, what is the value of the optimal\n",
    "    state-value function for the initial state of the game (starting\n",
    "    with $0$ dollars)? Your answer must be correct to $3$ decimal\n",
    "    places, truncated (e.g., 3.14159265 becomes 3.141).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To solve this problem, you will need to determine an optimal policy\n",
    "    for the game of DieN, given a particular configuration of the die.\n",
    "    As you will see, the action that is optimal will depend on your\n",
    "    current bankroll (i.e., how much money you've won so far).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You can try solving this problem by creating an MDP of the game\n",
    "    (states, actions, transition function, reward function, and assume a\n",
    "    discount rate of $\\gamma=1$) and then calculating the optimal\n",
    "    state-value function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts explored in this homework are covered by:\n",
